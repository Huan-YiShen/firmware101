// PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) 
// is a digital signal - so use a digital pins (on Arduino noted by symbol "~") 

// PWM is used to control the average power or amplitude (simulate analogue signal)
// of an electrical signal by varying the width of its pulses
// useful when fine volteage control is needed

// PWM is NOT a communication protocol, it is a digital modulation scheme (that can be 
// logically interpretated as an analogue signal), it is lower level than protocols.
